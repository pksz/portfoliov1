    <p class="lato-regular">
      Hey there! I'm Pankaj, a recent postgraduate in XYZ with a passion for building cool stuff with Python. While Python is my go-to language, I've dabbled in a few others along the way as i am always open to learning new things!
      <br>
      I've spent a lot of time working on web apps, APIs, and interactive tools, mostly using Django and Django REST Framework. Whether itâ€™s setting up authentication, handling databases, or making things run smoothly behind the scenes, I love figuring out how everything connects.
      <br>
      Right now, I'm on the lookout for an internship or job opportunity where I can keep learning, contribute to real-world projects, and grow as a developer. If you're working on something exciting, feel free to reach out!
