    <p class="lato-regular">
      Hey there! I'm a recent MCA postgraduate  with a passion for building cool stuff with Python. While Python is my go-to language, I've dabbled in a few others along the way as i am always open to learning new things!
      <br>
      I've spent time working on web apps, APIs, and interactive tools, mostly using Django and Django REST Framework. Whether it's setting up authentication, handling databases, or making things run smoothly behind the scenes, I love figuring out how everything connects.
      <br>
      I'm  always on the lookout for an opportunity where I can keep learning, contribute to real-world projects, and grow as a developer. If you're working on something exciting, feel free to reach out!
